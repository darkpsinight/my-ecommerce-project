# 🧭 UPDATED & LOCKED ROADMAP (AUTHORITATIVE VERSION)
*(Starting from Step 24 — Major & Minor Steps Explicit)*

> Design principles:
> - Capability first, UI later
> - Financial authority exposed only after safety layers
> - Buyer UX never precedes support safety tooling
> - Backend / frontend parity required for authority steps

---

## 🔷 Step 24 — Admin & Support Authentication Hardening ✅ DONE

### Goal
Make Admin and Support dashboards session-safe, role-correct, and reliable before exposing any financial authority.

### 24.1 Backend
- 24.1.1 Access token TTL enforcement
- 24.1.2 Refresh token validation endpoint
- 24.1.3 Refresh token rotation (recommended)
- 24.1.4 Role claims enforcement:
  - `admin`
  - `support`

### 24.2 Frontend (REQUIRED)
- 24.2.1 Central auth state (store/context)
- 24.2.2 HTTP interceptor:
  - On 401 → refresh token → retry once
- 24.2.3 Silent refresh on:
  - App load
  - Route change / near-expiry
- 24.2.4 Forced logout only if refresh fails

### 24.3 Manual Tests
- Token expiry → silent refresh
- Invalid refresh → logout
- Multi-tab stability
- Role-restricted routes enforced

**Exit:** Stable Admin/Support sessions  
**Status:** ✅ DONE

---

## 🔷 Step 25 — Disputes, Escrow Control & Communication

> This step builds **all dispute and escrow authority**,  
> but intentionally **does NOT expose buyer dispute buttons yet**.

---

### 🟢 Step 25.1 — Dispute Creation & Escrow Freeze (Backend Capability) ✅ DONE

- Dispute records
- Escrow freeze on dispute creation
- Ledger invariants preserved

⚠️ **Important clarification**
- Buyer-facing “Open Dispute” button does **NOT** exist yet
- This step provides **capability only**, not UX

---

### 🟢 Step 25.2 — Dispute Core Backend Logic ✅ DONE
- Dispute state machine
- Escrow state transitions
- Idempotent logic
- No UI

---

### 🟢 Step 25.2.1 — Payout Integrity Stabilization (Backend Only) ✅ DONE
**(Blocking prerequisite before further dispute work)**

- Scheduler rewiring
- Deprecated payout service removal
- Identifier normalization (UUID vs ObjectId)
- Integrity monitor fixes
- Manual log verification

---

### 🟢 Step 25.3 — Buyer Wallet Ledger Foundation ✅ DONE
- Append-only ledger
- Buyer balances
- No spending allowed yet

---

### 🟢 Step 25.4 — Buyer ↔ Seller Order Chat (Pre-Dispute) ✅ DONE
- Order-scoped chat
- Locks when dispute exists
- No realtime
- UI issues (scroll, Tailwind visibility) resolved

---

### 🟡 Step 25.5 — Buyer Non-Financial Dispute Signals (Backend Only)

> **Capability exists, UI intentionally deferred**

Buyer signals supported at backend level:
- Escalate to support
- Mark dispute as resolved (signal only)

⚠️ Buyer cannot see or trigger these yet  
⚠️ No buyer dispute buttons in UI at this stage

---

### 🔴 Step 25.6 — Support / Admin Escrow & Dispute UI

**(STEP A — CURRENT ACTIVE STEP)** 🚧

### Goal

Allow Support/Admin to resolve disputes **without database access** and **without backend changes**.

---

#### Scope clarification (important)

This step is **frontend-focused**. Backend APIs listed below already exist and must only be consumed.

---

#### 25.6.1 Admin/Support READ APIs (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)

* `GET /admin/disputes`
* `GET /admin/disputes/:disputeId`
* Data consumed by UI only; no backend changes allowed
* Includes:

  * Dispute metadata
  * Order snapshot
  * Buyer & seller info
  * Escrow state
  * Full chat history (read-only)

---

#### 25.6.2 Admin/Support ACTION APIs (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)

* Release escrow
* Refund buyer
* Extend hold
* Idempotent
* Fully audited
* UI must handle loading, error, and confirmation states

---

#### 25.6.3 Support Dashboard UI (NEW — REQUIRED)

* Dispute list page
* Status / state filters
* Basic columns:

  * Dispute ID
  * Order ID
  * Status
  * Escrow state
  * Created at
* Row click navigates to dispute detail

---

#### 25.6.4 Dispute Detail UI (Support/Admin) (NEW — REQUIRED)

Sections:

1. Dispute summary
2. Order snapshot
3. Buyer & Seller identities
4. Buyer ↔ Seller chat (read-only)
5. Escrow state visibility

---

#### 25.6.5 Escrow Action Controls (UI)

* Action buttons:

  * Release escrow
  * Refund buyer
  * Extend hold
* Confirmation modal required
* Disabled during request
* Idempotency-safe retry handling

---

#### 25.6.6 Route & Role Enforcement (UI)

* Support-only and Admin-only routes enforced at frontend
* Buyer/Seller roles must be hard-blocked
* Unauthorized access results in redirect or error state

---

#### 25.6.7 Verification

* Support resolves disputes without DB access
* Escrow actions reflect correctly in ledger
* Refund updates buyer wallet
* Unauthorized users blocked at route level

**Exit:**
Support/Admin can fully and safely resolve disputes via UI only.
